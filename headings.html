<h1> THE ROAD NOT TAKEN </h1>
<h2> ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS BRIEFLY:</h2>
<h4>1. Where were the two roads? What was the poet’s difficulty?</h4>

<p>
 When the poet was travelling he came across two diverging roads in a forest. It was difficult for
 him to decide which road he should take. Both roads seemed equally good and similar.
</p>
<h4>2. How did the poet make his choice about the road?</h4>
<p>
 The poet stood for a long time and looked at the diverging roads. Then he took the one which
 he considered better than the other one. It seemed to him grassy and less worn out. He thought
 that he would come back one day to try the other road.
</p>
<h4> 3. Did the poet make his choice without thinking?</h4>
<p>
 No, the poet infact took a long time to make his choice. He looked down the road as far as he
 could . Then he selected that one which seemed to have a better claim. It was grassy and
 wanted wear.
</p>
<h4>4. Was the poet sure of coming back to the first road some day?</h4>
<p>
. No, the poet was not sure if he would return to take up the first road someday. The poet knew
 that one road would lead to another and it might not be possible to come back and try the first
 one.
